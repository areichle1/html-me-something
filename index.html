            <p>We went to visit this citadel in San Juan. It was built in the 16th century. 
                We explored and found a lot of hidden spots within it.</p>

            <img src="images/2008 July Vacation Puerto Rico Wed. 1071.jpg" alt="rainforest waterfall">
            <p>We drove up into the El Yunque rainforest. The waterfalls were beautiful and
                it was raining the whole time we were up on the mountain.</p>

            <p>We took a day trip and went to the island of Culebra. It is located 17 miles
                off the coast of Puerto Rico. We went to a beach there and there were hardly
                 any people.</p>

            <p>We took surfing lessons. I had never surfed before I tried it on this trip
                and I really enjoyed it.</p>

<!--Still add more div tags, I think i'm using the article tag right.
Actually, the project info doesn't say I need a div tag. The example just uses
 1 article tag and a bunch of section tags in the middle.-->
